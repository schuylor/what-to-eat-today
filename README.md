# What Should We Eat Today? （Chinese Version)

A tiny, cozy web app I built for people who can never decide what to eat.
deployments (click to use): https://schuylor.github.io/what-to-eat-today/

It features cute monkey & sheep illustrations, floating cartoon plates, a random dish generator, and optional background music.  
Everything runs locally in the browser — no backend needed.
